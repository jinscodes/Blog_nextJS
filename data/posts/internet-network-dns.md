## Why DNS?
For server and client communication, IP is necessarily needed. However, IP has problems to use for server and client communication.
- It's hard to remember full IP
- IP can be changed

IP is consisted of series of number like `100.100.100.1` or `200.200.200.2` which is very hard to remember it. Whenever communicatoin between server and client is needed, it's impossible for users to remember the specific IP and use it.

There is another problem to use IP. Although users can remember the IP, IP can be changed. If the IP is changed, user can't access the page that the user want to visit.

## DNS ( Domain Name System )
> DNS is a decentralized system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, enabling computers to locate and connect to websites and services on the internet
