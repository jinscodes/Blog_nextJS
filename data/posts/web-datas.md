During web development, there are times when binary data needs to be dealt with.

In the browser, it is mainly related to file creation, upload, download, or image processing, and in the server side node.js, there may be a situation in which raw data from file to buffer is handled.

Binary data is rarely directly handled during programming. This is due to the fact that advanced language is used to program, so if a human-readable natural language is coded, the program internally converts it into binary data to read and process it. 

However, it becomes difficult when dealing with multimedia data such as files, images, and videos, not integers, real numbers, or letters.

How to deal with the multimedia data?

## Binary

Binary refers to the base system for representing numbers using only 0 and 1 and is the most fundamental system in dealing with computer programming.
