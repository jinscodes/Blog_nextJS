## React Basic - What's React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interface    
Why we need to use React instead of JavaScript?

- Making it easier to create Web or Mobile apps
- Making it easier to build From simple static sites to complex scale
- So many places used React ( #1 most used framework )
- Available in multiple: React | React Native | Electron | NextJs etc..
- SPA ( Single Page Application ), CSR ( Client Side Rendering )  
      -> With NextJs or Gatsby, Being able to use SSG ( Static Site Generation ) and SSR ( Server Side Rendering )
