## Before looking at React, Framework Versus Library

![](/data/posts/react-basic.png)

## React Basic - What's React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interface    
Why we need to use React instead of JavaScript?

- Making it easier to create Web or Mobile apps
- Making it easier to build From simple static sites to complex scale
- So many places used React ( #1 most used framework )
- Available in multiple: React | React Native | Electron | NextJs etc..
- SPA ( Single Page Application ), CSR ( Client Side Rendering )  
      -> With NextJs or Gatsby, Being able to use SSG ( Static Site Generation ) and SSR ( Server Side Rendering )

## Convention (or Philosophy) of the React

> One Root, Several Components   
> A highly cohesive building block for UIs loosely coupled with other components

When I heard the above two quotes, I realized that I needed to change my attitude to the website. In normal case, people view a website without considering structures, but programmer using React need to approach the website with a little special perspective. "Another perspectives" means that when programmers look at the website, they need to see the website is composed of boxes or containers.
