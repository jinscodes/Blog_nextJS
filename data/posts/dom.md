## Intro...
As you develop, you will inevitably see a lot of things related to DOM. You can write the code even if you don't know what DOM is, but you can't fully understand how and how it works.

Therefore, it is very important to know about DOM.

This post is about dom.

## Types Of Browser DOM
After loading the HTML document, the browser generates a model for the document in memory.

At this time, the model consists of a tree of objects, which is called a DOM tree.

#### Document Node
It exists at the top of the tree and must be through the document node to access elements and text nodes, respectively.

That is, it is an entry point for accessing the DOM tree.

#### Element Node


#### Attribute Node

#### Text Node
