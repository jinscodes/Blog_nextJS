## What's Generic?
The reason why we use the repository of variables in programming is for flexibility in data values. The word variable refers to something that can change and vice versa, the constant is always fixed.
Â 
Based on this concept, the type we've used up to this point, number[] and string, has always been fixed and never changed. And a little bit of flexibility is added to this is the number | string | undefined union type.


*However, in this programming environment, the situation is not always fixed and does not flow as intended.*

It is in this industry that variables that can change when and where always occur.

Therefore, instead of specifying the type directly as a fixed value, a device that can code more flexibly through a type that can change at any time through a "variable" is needed, and this is the **generic** type to be dealt with today.

*Simply, it can be said that the type is a variable.*
Â 
Let's use the following code example to find out why generics should not be left out of type scripts.

We create a method called `add()`, which is a versatile multi-method that adds numbers to make integers and adds strings to make combined strings.
Since the two types of numbers and strings are handled at the same time, the simple one can be configured as follows through the union type.

```ts
function add(x: string | number, y: string | number): string | number {
   return x + y;
}

add(1, 2); // 3
add('hello', 'world'); // 'helloworld'
```

At first glance, there seems to be no problem, but there is a catch here.

The Union is the trap.

We intended `x: string, y: string`, or `x: number, y: number`, but there is a possibility that it could actually be `x: string, y: number`, or `x: number, y: string`.

Thus, the compiler catches these things smartly and informs us of the errors with red lines.

How do we solve this?Â 

This multi-method was declared as a union type, which became a problem. Then, we only need to separate the function and distribute it so that only one role is played in one function type.

In TypeScript, this is called the **function overload**.

```ts
function add(x: string, y: string): string;
function add(x: number, y: number): number;
function add(x: any, y: any) {
   return x + y;
}

add(1, 2); // 3
add('hello', 'world'); // 'helloworld'

// Overloading does not allow the next function call to occur.
// add(1, '2');
// add('1', '2');
```

However, as the number of types allowed increases, the code becomes longer, making it less readable.

This is why **generics** came out because of these limitations.

By designating it as a angle brackets and a capital letter T variable as follows, the type declared in the code through generics can be converted into a variable, and the type can be flexibly used later.

```ts
function add<T>(x: T, y: T): T { // Generic: Expressions using the angle brackets and the letter T. T is a variable name.
   return x + y;
}

add<number>(1, 2); // When calling a generic type function, if it is determined as <number>, the T part of the function is changed to number and executed.
add<string>('hello', 'world'); // 'helloworld'
```

## Advanced Type - Generics
In this way, the Generic type provides a way to declare a type at the time of use, not at the time of declaration of a function or class.

It is a principle that variables or function interfaces can be reused in various types by simply writing down variable characters when declaring and determining the type used at the time of creation.

The characteristics of generics are listed as follows.

- It prevents the type from being fixed and can declare reusable elements.
- Ensure type stability by conducting type checks at compilation time.
- Casting-related codes can be removed.
- Generic logic can be used to create reuse codes that can receive different types.

Generic is originally a type that is often used to create highly reusable components in languages such as C# and Java. In particular, it is used to create components that operate in more than one type.

In fact, if looking at the method type form of the Typescript library, it is all composed of generics.

The above picture is the ts library related to cookie. There is a generic type.

> **ðŸ’¡ NOTE**   
> If the deflection <> symbol is used in front of the variable name and the function name, it becomes a 'type affirmation'.    Therefore, in order to implement a generic, you must write a deflection parenthesis after the variable name and the function name.

> And the generic name does not have to be T. I can attach it as I want, but I customarily process it in one capital letter. (T, U, K...)
