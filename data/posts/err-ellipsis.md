## Intro...
There is a property `text-overflow: ellipsis;` in CSS.

It makes the sentence add ellipsis(...) at the end of the word or sentence.

However, elipsis is sometimes not applied in some cases.

In this post, we will discuss experiences where elipsis was not applied.

## Error While Using Library
In general, when configuring the web, using `text-overflow: ellipsis;` usually doesn't cause problems. (Of course, IE does cause problems.) However, in my case, it was not a problem caused by IE because it does not deal with IE.

In HTML+CSS+JS structure, an image was on a webpage and text was stacked on top of the image. It was necessary to take a screenshot with elipsis(...) at the end of the text.

To automate screenshots of web pages, I used a library called **HTML2Canvas**.
