In the previous post, we looked at modules and the import and export of modules. 

This post deals with how to dynamically import modules and browser modules. Let's get it!

## Import Dynamically
Export and import statements that we've covered in the previous post are **"Static"** way.

The grammar is simple, but there are some limits.

What's the constraint and how to sovle it?
What are the constraints and how should I address them?

### Constraint

1. The First constraint is that dynamic parameteres are not available for import statements.

	```javascript
	import ... from getModule(); // causing error
	```

	1. Because the module path can only contain raw strings, it was not possible to write the result value of the function call as the path.

2. The second constraint is the module cannot be imported dependingo on the run-time or condition

	```javascript
	if (...) {
		import ...; // causing error
	}

	{
		import ...; // causing error
	}
	```

	1. Because the module cannot be imported conditionally (first example) and cannot be placed inside the brackets (second example).

### Import(module)
> `import(module)` reads module and then **returns an migrated promise containing an object** that contains all of the things it exports.

`import(module)` can be used dynamically anywhere.

```javascript
let modulePath = prompt("which module do you want?");

import (modulePath)
  .then(obj => "<Module Object>")
  .catch(e => "<Loading error... There is no matched module>");
```

It can be used in `async` function

```js
let module = await import(modulePath);
```

### Example of import module dynamically

Let's make module using app.js

```js
// app.js
export function alphabet() {
  alert("a b c d e f g");
}

export function number() {
  alert("1 2 3 4 5 6 7");
}
```

we can import the module dynamically following the below code

```js
let app = await import('./app.js');
app.alphabet();
app.number();

let {alphabet, number} = await import('./app.js');
alphabet();
number();
```

Trying to add default export to app.js

```js
export default function() {
	alert("Bring the module that is export default");
}
```

To use default export module, using default property like below

```js
let obj = await import('./app.js');
let app = obj.default;

app();
```

or 

```js
let {default: app} = await import('./app.js');

app();
```

> ðŸ’¡ dynamic import works in normal script. `script type="module"` is not needed.

> ðŸ’¡ import() has similarity as function call and grammar, but it's not function call.
	It's one of the special grammar using brackets like super().
	Therefore, it's impossible to copy to variables or use call/apply. This is because it's not function!
