## Intro..
One day a cocoapod error suddenly came to me. The flutter that was working well didn't work and I had to fix the error.

I tried to reinstall cocoapod but another errors occurs. I don't know why this happen to me, but I solved it.

This post is about the error that I experienced before and the solution. 

## ðŸš¨ CocoaPods not installed or not in valid state

Obviously, until yesterday, there was no problem running the flutter. However, since I installed something, I have encountered an error like the picture above.

I kept looking for reasons, but I couldn't find them. Maybe I changed something I shouldn't have touched while modifying ~/.zshrc before.

Firstly, I downloaded Cocoapods according to the error above using homebrew. 

```bash
$ brew cleanup -d -v
```

```bash
$ brew install cocoapods
```

But, `brew install` didn't work properly because of the authority. So, I used `sudo gen install`

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

However, it's not working. Another error occurs in a row.

## ðŸš¨ Failed to build gem native extension.

The error indicates a problem building the native extension for the CocoaPods gem. This can be caused by missing dependencies or issues with the development environment.

To solve this error, there are serveral steps.

#### 1. Install Command Line Tools
Ensure Xcode Command Line Tools installed. I installed them by running the following command in the terminal.

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

#### 2. Update Homebrew
If the version of Homebrew is low, update it with the following commands.

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade
```

#### 3. Install Required Dependencies
CocoaPods may require some dependencies to be installed on my system. Install them using Homebrew.

```bash
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install openssl
```

> ðŸ’¡ In my case, I didn't do this. So, I think this step can be skipped. 

#### 4. Install CocoaPods Agagin
I tried to install CocoaPods again.

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

If wants to specify the version, follow the below command

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods -v 1.11.2
```

## ðŸš¨ 
I installed ruby thorugh homebrew and upgraded it to the lastest version. However, I checked the version of ruby in terminal, ruby version is not upraded. like this ruby 2.6.10p210 (2022-04-12 revision 67958) [universal.arm64e-darwin21].
