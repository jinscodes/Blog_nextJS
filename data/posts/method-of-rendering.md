I knew that there are four method of rendering while preparing for my blog project using NextJs. Nextjs is a framework that allows React to perform server side rendering.

But, Nextjs is not only using SSR but also CSR, SSG, and ISR.

## CSR ( Client Side Rendering )
> It refers to a rendering method in which the subject who renders is a client(browser).

### CSR 작동 방식(원리)
1. Client sends a request to the server
	1. At this time, the browser will turn the loading bar while waiting for the request
