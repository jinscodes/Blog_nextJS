## Intro..
There was a situation where I had to use Navigator while making a simple app for practice with a flutter.

I looked at document to use Navigator correctly, and there were two types: `Navigator.push` and `Navigator.pushReplacement`.

Both `Navigator.push` and `Navigator.pushReplacement` work similarly. 

So, what exactly is the difference between the two? And what should be used in what situations?

## Navigator.push
