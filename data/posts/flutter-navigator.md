## Intro..
There was a situation where I had to use Navigator while making a simple app for practice with a flutter.

I looked at document to use Navigator correctly, and there were two types: `Navigator.push` and `Navigator.pushReplacement`.

Both `Navigator.push` and `Navigator.pushReplacement` work similarly. 

So, what exactly is the difference between the two? And what should be used in what situations?

> More details about the router in the flutter will be discussed later. Now this post is a simple comparison between Navigator.push and Navigator.pushReplacement.

## Difference Between Navigator.push And Navigator.pushReplacement
The biggest difference between Navigator.push and Navigator.pushReplacement is whether the previous screen is present or not.

#### Navigator.push
`Navigator.push` builds up the previous screen. This is because push works in the form of a stack.

Since the previous screen is drawn on the new screen with the accumulated screen, it is possible to go back.

Also, since it is possible to go back, a go back button is automatically generated in AppBar.
