Destructuring assignment is one of the features introduced in ES6. Also, it's also one of the most popular features.

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JS expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

### Destructuring Array

If the number of variables you want to assign is greater than the length of the array you want to disassemble, the error will not occur, because if there is no value to assign, it will be treated as undefined.

Using `=`, you can set a 'default value', which is the value to be allocated as a default when there is no value to allocate.

Complicated expressions or functions can be a default value.
