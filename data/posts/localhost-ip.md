## localhost? 127.0.0.1?

When the web developers did the local debugging, they usually saw the **localhost**. For example, if F/E developers executed `npm run` and open the web page, there is `http://localhost:xxx/index.html` on the url.

Unconciously, they didn't use it without thinking about it. But, that didn't mean that it's not important.
