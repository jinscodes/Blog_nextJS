## localhost? 127.0.0.1?

When the web developers did the local debugging, they usually saw the **localhost**. For example, if F/E developers executed `npm run` and open the web page, there is `http://localhost:xxx/index.html` on the url.

Unconciously, they didn't use it without thinking about it. But, that didn't mean that it's not important.

### localhost

![localhost](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebe83f0e-b4b5-4e8d-9b30-2b724cc83c56)

localhost is a domain name that is essentially not different from the domain name used for Internet access. However, there is a difference in that it is easy to remember.

The range of localhost is limited to local devices. As the name suggests, "local" means being in close proximity.

For example, my friend Youngchul and I can use localhost on our respective computers to access individual page content in an independent environment.
