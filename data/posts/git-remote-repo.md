#### What is Git Repository?
It's a repository on the Internet or somewhere in the network. 

Even a remote repository can be located on a local system. (It can actually exist on the same local system.) 

The name 'remote' must be used so that the repository is somewhere far away from the network or the Internet. It doesn't mean you have to stay away from it. Of course, as with ordinary remote storage, you use the same functions as Push, Pull, etc.
