## Intro..
The above errors often occurred when importing images or files using TypeScript. 

This post is about TS error resolution.

## Error
**[Typescript] TS2307: Cannot find module '.png' or its corresponding type declarations.**

While starting a new project with React and TypeScript, I tried to import an image file with a *.png* extension name, but the error appeared, so it didn't work. 

When I searched and looked it up, it was because the type was not defined.

```json
// tsconfig.json
...
"typeRoots": ["src/types"],
...
```

I added the .d.ts file to the src/types folder to add the type. 

The image could be imported successfully.

```ts
// src/types/images.d.ts
declare module '*.png';
declare module '*.jpg';
declare module '*.jpeg';
```

Of course, there are other ways.

We can also use the type in more detail to declare each extension of the image.

```ts
declare module "*.svg" {
	import * as React from "react";

	export const ReactComponent: React.FuncctionComponent<
		React.SVGProps<SVGVGElement> & {title?: string }
	>;

	const src: string;
	export default src;
}

declare module "*.png" {
	const png: string;
	export default png;
}
```

Both of the above examples work fine as normal.

> ðŸ’¡ If the error persists after declaring each extension in the d.ts file as above, try turning off and on the vsCode.
