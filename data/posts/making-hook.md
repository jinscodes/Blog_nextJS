> Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8.

## Custom Hook
> A custom hook in React is a reusable function that encapsulates logic, allowing components to share and manage stateful or side-effect-related code, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

In React, there are so many hooks we can use. It's useful and helps us use the functions we want conveniently and efficiently.

However, when we design the architecture or write codes, we can realize that there are overlapping codes(functions). When codes are overlapped several times, we need to make **custom hooks**. 

Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.



```json
↳ src
  ↳ hooks
    ↳ customHook.ts
```
