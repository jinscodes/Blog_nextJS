There are two main ways to change the app logo in Flutter.

- Changing the logo image files
- Using package

## Changing Files
Of course, the first thing to prepare is a image of an app icon. The standard for the image is 1024x1024.

As an example, we prepared the following 1024x1024 images.

### Converting image to app icon
Having a 1024x1024 image doesn't mean that it can be used as an app icon right away.

Because image files that is used on Android and IOS, the image mush be converted.

Of course, we don't have to convert the image ourselves. We can put the image we want on the site that converts the image, download it, and use it.
