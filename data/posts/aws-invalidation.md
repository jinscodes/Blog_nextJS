I released company's introduction page with AWS S3 + CloudFront + Route53. After releasing, there are some changes, so I needed to upload the new codes.

I fixed the codes and build the file. I uploaded build file to the AWS server. But, the changes was not reflected to the page.

**What's the problem?**

## Problem Analysis

Do the service via CloudFront, the project modifications do not apply immediately.

The reason for the issue is CloudFront's cache function, and it is said that the cache is maintained for 24 hours by default. Therefore, no matter how much you reload and rebuild and distribute changes, the modified contents are not reflected.

CloudFront caches files at each edge and uses cached files without requesting Origin (the original file in the S3 bucket) until the TTL expires.

If you want to apply the changes right away, you should remove the cache.

> **S3** as file storage, **Route 53** as DNS, and **CloudFront** as Content Delivery Network (CDN)

## How To Clear Cache

It's not difficult to get rid of the cache from the CloudFront.

First of all, go to the **CloudFront** page.

Click the **Distributions**.

And then, check the distribution and click it.

If you click the distribution, you can see the page like the below image.

There are tabs. And we need an **Invalidations** tab.

![3](https://github.com/jinscodes/Blog_nextJS/assets/87598134/19492cf1-6be1-4124-a716-6ea5c235cd6b)

In **Invalidations**, there are invalidations that is already created.

What we need is a **Create invalidation**.

![4](https://github.com/jinscodes/Blog_nextJS/assets/87598134/26326007-35bb-4ecf-b6cd-9608a04c3604)

Click the **Create invalidation** button. And there is **Object path**.

![5](https://github.com/jinscodes/Blog_nextJS/assets/87598134/17c444cd-0c0d-4fa0-ab76-7727ad22f26c)

To remove the all caches, write `/*` like this üëáüèº.

As the result, **invalidation** is progressing for a while, and then when it's done, there is a **check status** at the bottom of the card(?).

![7](https://github.com/jinscodes/Blog_nextJS/assets/87598134/9bbfde54-c424-4509-baeb-77b70cfa2c99)

Once creating the invalidation, we can see the edited site.

> üí° **NOTE**  
> Even if the invalidation setting is performed, it is correct that the cache is removed and the updated file is cached again to be reflected, but it only operates once at the time the invalidation was created, and updates were not made every time there was a change thereafter.

> In other words, whenever there are some changes about the site and be needed to check it immediately, we must do the above sequence everytime.

## Automate AWS Invalidation

It's quite cumbersome and inconvenient to invalidate whenever contents are needed to update.

This is because we have to do the same process.

In most case, **lambda** function is used to automate AWS Invalidtaion. However, in the case of static contents, we don't need to use lambda function because we already know when the contents are uploaded and when the cache is invalidated.

### @aws-sdk/client-cloudfront

To use CloudFront SDK, `@aws-sdk/client-cloudfront` is needed.

```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-cloudfront

# or

yarn add @aws-sdk/client-cloudfront
```

And then, set the CloudFrontClient

```tsx
const cloudfrontClient = new CloudFrontClient({
  region: "",
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: "",
    secretAccessKey: "",
  },
});
```

- **region**: Write down the region of the original object. If you don't write it down, it won't be executed, so you have to write it down.
- **accessKeyId**
- **secretAccessKey**

> You can check the region from S3 bucket's prodperties tab.

### CreateInvalidationCommand

To invalidate the cache, use `CreateInvalidationCommand`.

We create `info` and send this `info` to `CreateInvalidationCommand` object. And then, send this object to `CloudFrontClient`.

```jsx
const client = new CloudFrontClient(config);

const cacheInvalidationInfo = {
  DistributionId: "CDN ID",
  InvalidationBatch: {
    Paths: {
      Quantity: pathList.length,
      Items: pathList,
    },
    CallerReference: String(new Date().getTime()),
  },
};

const command = new CreateInvalidationCommand(cacheInvalidationInfo);

await this.cloudFrontClient.send(command);
```

If you want to know about the properties, go to the below link üëáüèº

[](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/client/cloudfront/command/CreateInvalidationCommand/)

About the above code, every properties(fields) are essential value.

We can enter the path of the object to be invalidated in `InvalidationBatch.Paths.Items`.
