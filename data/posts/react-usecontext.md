Through this `useContext`, developers can share the datas easily across multiple components without prop drilling.

- Sharing Data Across Components
- Avoiding Prop Drilling

### Sharing Data Across Components
One of the main benefits of contextual use is the ability to share data across multiple components, which is particularly useful when dealing with data that must be accessed by multiple components at different levels of the component tree.

### Avoiding Prop Drilling
Prop drilling is the process of transferring data from one component to another through Prop. If data has to be passed through multiple levels of components, it can be cumbersome and difficult to manage. Context eliminates the need for prop drilling by providing a centralized way to share data.
