While studying algorithm, I wrote the code to solve it. I passed almost test case, but I couldn't pass the some of the test case.

The algorithm test is making JadenCase string array.

> **JadenCase?**  
> JadenCase means that every first alphabet should be the uppercase and other digits should be the lowercase. Also, if the first digit is not the alphabet, all strings become the lowercase except for the first.

> For example, "for the last week" returns "For The Last Week", and "3people unFollowed me" returns "3people Unfollowed Me"

I solved this on my way. The below code is mine that is not fixed.

And I fixed my code like this.

The only difference is about `str[index]` and `str.charAt(index)`.

### Str[index] VS Str.charAt(index)

So, what't the problem?

##### Empty string

Actually, `str[index]` and `str.charAt(index)` return the same result. For instance, about the string `const str = "Jay's blog"`, `str[0]` and `str.charAt(0)` return "J". Like this, the above my answers returned the same result.

Although those codes return the same result, the reason why those codes couldn't pass the some test cases is how it deals with the empty string.

In the case of `str[indx]`, when `str[index]` is empty string, it will return undefined. Unlike it, `str.charAt(index)` will return the empty string "".

So, explain it with the example... If the test case is "hello world", both codes will return the same result. But if the test case is "ㅤhelloㅤㅤworldㅤ", it will cause run-time error.

##### Browser

The `charAt(index)` method is part of ECMAScript 3.

The charAt() method has excellent browser support as it has been part of JavaScript since ES 3 (1999). It is supported in all modern and legacy browsers.

The second way `str[index]` requires ECMAScript 5 support.

It is to treat the string as an array-like object, where each individual characters correspond to a numerical index. This has been supported by most browsers since their first version, except for IE. It was standardised in ES 5.

### Conclusion

str.charAt(i) is better from a compatibility perspective if IE6/IE7 compatibility is required.

str[i] is more modern and works in IE8+ and all other browsers (all Edge/Firefox/Chrome, Safari 2+, all iOS/Android).
