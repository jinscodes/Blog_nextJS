## Intro...
The power of flutter is enormous these days. 

Although my goal is to make application and release it on the market, it's not easy to approach native because it's so difficult. However, Flutter made it relatively easy to access the app.

Just because flutter is easier than other native doesn't mean it's as easy as it gets. 

This post is about making flutter project. Let's get it!

## Settings
It's necessary to do a lot of settings to develop the app using Flutter. 

#### VScode
Most developers may have experience using VScode or may be using it.

To use Flutter via VScode, we need to install extensions.

## Xcode
Flutter is a cross-platform for mobile application, so we can make ios application using flutter.

When developing ios app, using ios simulator and releasing it through Xcode. Therefore, Xcode is needed when developing the app.
