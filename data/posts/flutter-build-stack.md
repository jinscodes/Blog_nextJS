We can‚Äôt just have a beautiful application that does nothing functional. 

We will be required to move around the application or send data back and forth between screens.

In Flutter, navigation from one screen to another is possible because of Navigators, a simple widget that maintains a stack of Routes, or in simpler terms, a history of visited screens/pages.

## Push
**Push** 

If you have any knowledge in Data Structures, then you know about Stacks. If you have even basic knowledge of stacks, then you know about push and pop.

The data structure and stack are always related, so if you know about the data structure, you know about the stack (at least you've heard of it). 

If you know about the stack, you've heard about push and pop.

pushing is adding element to the top of a stack of elements and popping is removing the top element from the same stack.

So in case of Flutter, when we navigate to another screen, we use the push methods and Navigator widget adds the new screen onto the top of the stack. Naturally, the pop methods would remove that screen from the stack.

### Navigator.push()
If there is no data to send, it's possible to change the screen through `Navigator.push()`.

```dart
Navigator.push(
	context,
	MaterialPageRoute(
		builder: (context)=>AnotherScreen(),
	),
);
```

### Navigator.pushNamed()
We can provide the path through MaterialApp's property, `initialRoute` and `rotues`.

`initialRoute` sets the start screen. If making a map of screenName and Wideget in the `routes` and specify it, you can switch a simple screen call through the string.

```dart
MaterialApp(
	title: "Flutter App",
	theme: ThemeData(
		primaryColor: Colors.blue,
		brightness: Brightness.dark,
	),
	initialRoute: HomeScreen.routeName,
	routes: routes,
)

final routes = {
	HomeScreen.routeName: (_) => HomeScreen(),
	AnotherScreen.routeName: (_) => AnotherScreen(),
};

Navigator.pushNamed(context, AnotherScreen.routeName);
```

Or,

```dart
Navigator.push(
	context,
	MaterialPageRoute(
		settings: const RouteSettings(
			name: AnotherScreen.routeName,
		),
		builder: (context) => AnotherScreen(),
	),
);
```

### Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil()
`Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil()` do `push()` the pages and remove the pages in the stack.

```dart
Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(context, newRouteName, (route) => false);
```

Remove all previous pages from stack

```dart
Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(
	context, 
	ThirdScreen.routeName, 
	(route) => false, 
	arguments: {"update": true}
);
```

Or, remove all before a particular page in the stack

```dart
Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(
	context,
	ThridScreen.routeName,
	ModalRoute.withName(SecondScreen.routeName),
	arguments: {"update": true},
);
```

### Navigator.pushReplacementNamed()
`Navigator.pushReplacementNamed()` allows to remove the current page from the stack and put the page you want to move into the stack.

```dart
Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, ThridScreen.routeName);
```

## Pop
**Pop**

To get rid of the last visited screen, we need to pop routes from the Navigator's stack using `pop()` method.

```dart
Navigator.of(context).pop();
```

This line of code godes inside the `onPress` method.

When using Scaffold, it usually isn‚Äôt necessary to explicitly pop the route, because the Scaffold automatically adds a ‚Äòback‚Äô button to its AppBar, which would call `Navigator.pop()` on pressed.   
Even in Android, pressing the device back button would do the same.

However, `pop()` is definitely needed in some cases.

The reason for using pop is to reduce confusion. 

For example, let's say you buy something on the Internet. A specific item was selected on the item **list screen** and moved to the **detail screen**. However, if you didn't like the item and press pushing back button(not pop), the **detail screen** will move to the **item list screen** while remaining in the stack. Press back again from there to return to the detail screen.

### maybePop
Suppose you are on the initial path and someone is accidentally trying to pop this screen

Popping the only screen on the stack would close your app, because then it has no route to display.

You definitely don‚Äôt want your user to have such an unexpected user experience. That's the reason why `maybePop()` is needed.

So it‚Äôs like, pop only if you can. Try it out, click on the maybePop Button on Screen1 and it will do nothing. Because there is nothing to pop. Now try the same on Screen3 and it will pop the screen. Because it can.

*How can I know if this is the initial route?*

### canPop
It would be nice if I could display some alert to user in such cases.

Great question, just call this `canPop()` method and it would return true if this route can be popped and false if it‚Äôs not possible.
