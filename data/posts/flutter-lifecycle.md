## Intro..
With flutter, stateless and stateful widgets are used. 

While using stateless and stateful, I felt that I needed to study how the state of the flutter works.

This post is about lifecycle of the flutter.

## What Is Lifecycle of The StatefulWidget
The Stateful widget has a lifecycle. 

In the Flutter app, the lifecycle of widgets from creation to destruction is managed, and specific methods are called at a specific point in the life cycle. 

Understanding the state of this lifecycle enables precise control of widgets. The **build method** and **initState method** that we use without being aware of when creating widgets are also related to the lifecycle.

- createState
- initState
- build
- setState
- dispose
