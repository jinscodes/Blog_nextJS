We can provide users with the ability to choose a particular item's choice in a variety of ways.

`ModalBottomSheet` is the one of them.

If there are few items and options, a checkbox and a radio button are sufficient.

However, if there are more than three to five options or if there are many items, I think it can reduce the user's readability. 

One way is to use the `ModalBottomSheet` widget at this time.

## ModalBottomSheet
Just add the `showModalBottomSheet` widget and it's done.

Note that modal widgets should be created in event codes such as onTap, onPressed, etc.

### Modal Design With Margin
Sometimes modals with left and right margins are used.
