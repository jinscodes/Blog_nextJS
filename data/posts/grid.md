## Intro..
The typical CSS layout is `flex`. However, there are times when we need to use another layout instead of `flex` in some cases.

It's GRID!

Flex and grid are similar but different.

There are some areas where Flex and Grid overlap, so if we know Flex, we can study more easily.

## GRID
The biggest differences between flex and grid is

- Flex is a one-way layout system (1D)
- Grid is a two-way (horizontal-vertical) layout system (2D)

Therefore, more complex layout representation is possible than flex.
