## Interpreted Language

Interpreteres run through a program line by line and execute each command. In other words, interpreter language is one of programming language that executes instructions directly, without compiling the code into machine language.

Interpreted language ranges - JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, Ruby, etc.

#### Benefit

Interpreted Languages offer flexibility and faster development.

## Compiled Language

A compiled language is a programming language that is generally compiled and not interpreted. It is one where the program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine; this machine code is undecipherable by humans.

Types of compiled language â€“ C, C++, C#, CLEO, COBOL, etc.

#### Benefit

Compiled languages are usually faster and more efficient than interpreted languages. They also give developers more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage.
