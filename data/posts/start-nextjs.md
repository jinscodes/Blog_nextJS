## Intro...
In Company, I've never used NextJS because the company used only ReactJS + TailwindCSS. So, I wanted to learn another frameworks and style tools. 

For using other framework and tool, I decided to use NestJS and SCSS for my blog project.

This post is about the initial setting of the NextJS.

## Create a Next.js App
To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
- You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.
