## Intro...
In Company, I've never used NextJS because the company used only ReactJS + TailwindCSS. So, I wanted to learn another frameworks and style tools. 

For using other framework and tool, I decided to use NestJS and SCSS for my blog project.

This post is about the initial setting of the NextJS.

## About NextJS
To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
- You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

A framework can solve these problems. **Next.js** provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

### Features
**Next.js** aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

- An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
- Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
- Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
- Development environment with Fast Refresh support
