## Intro...
As React-router-dom was updated to V6, there was a change in routing.

The change is larger than other updates, so I'm writing a post to organize it separately.

## <Routes> VS <Switch>

## <Route element> VS <Route children>

## No Need To Install “react-router-config” Separately

## Use “useNavigate” instead of “useHistory”

## Replace “Redirect” with “Navigate”

## You don’t need the “exact” Prop anymore
