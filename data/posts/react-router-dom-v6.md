## Intro...
As React-router-dom was updated to V6, there was a change in routing.

The change is larger than other updates, so I'm writing a post to organize it separately.

## <Routes> VS <Switch>
In v5, we could use `<Switch>` to wrap our routes but in v6 `<Switch>` is not exported from react-router-dom. 

Now we’ll have to use `<Routes>` to do the same thing instead of `<Switch>`.

`<Routes>` is similar to `<Switch>`, but it is much more powerful because it makes the code simpler and more predictable and can be nested in one place instead of distributing it across multiple components.

> 💡 **NOTE**   
> `<Routes>` is a required parent component that should be used for individual `<Route>` components, rather than replacing `<Switch>`. However, `<Routes>` at the same time is an advanced way to compare URLs and `<Route>`.

## <Route element> VS <Route children>
The component that should be rendered on matching a route can not be written as children of the “Route component”, but it takes a prop called “element” where we have to pass a JSX component to be rendered. 

Another important reason for using the “element” prop in v6 is that <Route children> is reserved for nesting routes.

## No Need To Install “react-router-config” Separately
React-router-config allowed the path to be defined as a JavaScript object instead of a React element, and all features have now moved to the core React Router v6.

V5: 

![3-1](https://github.com/jinscodes/Blog_nextJS/assets/87598134/a64d29a3-a060-410a-9012-4474eaba816f)

## Use “useNavigate” instead of “useHistory”
React Router v6 introduces a new navigation API that is synonymous with <Link> and provides better compatibility with suspense-enabled apps.

V5:

![4-1](https://github.com/jinscodes/Blog_nextJS/assets/87598134/54a496e2-2a78-4baa-a23f-0cea52582e3d)

v6 requires rewriting this app to use the navigation API. In most cases this means changing useHistory to useNavigate.

V6:

![4-2](https://github.com/jinscodes/Blog_nextJS/assets/87598134/268fc051-a7e8-4550-916f-db1a61287f7c)

## Replace “Redirect” with “Navigate”
Redirection is no longer exported from React-Router-dom.

Instead, you can use Navigate to achieve the same functionality.

V5:

![5-1](https://github.com/jinscodes/Blog_nextJS/assets/87598134/09592f91-7173-46fc-8ddb-f4fbc9dfbf14)

V6: 

![5-2](https://github.com/jinscodes/Blog_nextJS/assets/87598134/a09353e2-5494-4045-bc1c-d0aedc6d12ce)

Do note that the replace prop is passed inside the element of the Route which signifies that we are replacing the current navigation stack.

Without replace, it would mean we are just pushing the component in the existing navigation stack.

## You don’t need the “exact” Prop anymore
React router’s better path matching algorithm enables us to match a particular route match without the “exact” prop. 

Earlier, without “exact”, any URL starting with the concerned keyword would be loaded, as the matching process was done from top to down the route definitions.

We don’t need to worry about that now as React Router has a better algorithm for loading the best route for a particular URL, the order of defining does not really matter now.
