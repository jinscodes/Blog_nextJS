In the previous project, I didn't use state management library. I'd experienced problems related to state management. So, I felt that I need to know about state management libraries.

In this post, I'll introduce zustand.

## What is zustand?

Before zustand, there is Redux. Redux changed the game in the global management system. In any framework, it was adopted and used as the tool of ideal state management.

Zustand is a new kid on the block. It's another powerful tool to handle the global statement.

#### So, what is zustand?

Zustand is a state management library. It is compact, fast, and scalable. It is a fairly simple system with little boilerplate code. You can use it with less code than Redux and similar libraries for managing React states.

It doesn‚Äôt rely on a provider. As a result, you don‚Äôt have to code as much React logic, which may lessen the things we tend to forget. It works based on simplified flux principles and primarily makes use of hooks.

- It is faster than context. It gives you the option to choose a specific state.
- It does state merging by default.
- It is extendable by default. Thus, you can use a variety of middleware types.
- It is less opinionated. You don‚Äôt have to stick to one way of doing things. Even though there is a recommended approach, you are not required to adopt it.

## Getting started with Zustand

Let's start zustand.

First of all, below the code to install the zustand library.

```bash
$ npm istall zustand

or

$ yarn add zustand
```

To use zustand, import a create function.

```jsx
import { create } from "zustand";
```

This function is called with a callback function and it returns a custom hook.

The callback function passed to it is where we will define our state and the functions we can use to manipulate the state. The state and the functions are all in an object returned by this callback function.

There is an example üëáüèº:

There is a `create` function that passes a `set` function to the callback function.

This `set` function is used to manipulate the state in the store. States in zustand can be primitives, objects, or functions.
