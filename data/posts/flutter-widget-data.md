## Intro...
When I started my first flutter project as a side project, the first thing I created was a login page.

It was so different from the app to make up the web's login screen and data.

It was difficult to configure the screen, of course, but I struggled for a long time because I didn't know how to transfer it to another widget to save and use variables.

I tried to convey the variables through the constructor, but the statefulwidget was divided into two classes, and I didn't know how to use the variables received in the statefulwidget in the state class.
