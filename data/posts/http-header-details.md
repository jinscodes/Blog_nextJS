### Content-Type
The Content-Type header in HTTP is used to indicate the media type of the resource being sent to the recipient. 

It tells the client what the content type of the returned content is, such as text/html for HTML documents, application/json for JSON data, or image/jpeg for JPEG images. This header is crucial for the client to correctly process and display the received data.
