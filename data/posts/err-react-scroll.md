## Intro..
Sometimes, when working with long pages, it can be helpful to allow users to quickly scroll back to the top of the page. In React.js, this can be easily achieved with a few lines of code.

There are several ways to solve this problem.

## Scroll To Top
There are two ways to move the scroll up when moving the page.

- Without Library
- Using Library

> ðŸ’¡ The library referred to here is react-router-dom.

### Without Library: Custom Component

### Using Library Component: React-Router-Dom
React-router-dom covered in this section is only applicable to v6 (not sure if previous versions also had this feature).
